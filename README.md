# XPath to XML Processor
Very basic class for building the DOMDocument from the list of XPath's and corresponding data in certain format. You can specify **values of leaf nodes**, **values of attributes** for both **hierarchy and leaf nodes**. If I've missed something, please, open the ticket and let me know.

Tutorial on input format is available at http://alexshumilov.ru/xpath-xml-php/, also you can look it up in the test suite.
